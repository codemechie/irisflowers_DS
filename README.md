# irisflowers_DS
Iris flowers is the go-to dataset for those new to machine learning. It is a fairly simple ML model and focuses on the steps involved in crating a ML model.
This is a python project that builds a ML model for the classification of iris flowers.
Being an entry-level ML project, it does not get into the nitty-gritty of ML algortihms or Python functions. As a beginner your only goal while going through this project should be: loading data, looking at the data, evaluating some algorithms and making some predictions.

TIP: IF YOU ARE NEW TO PYTHON...focus on function calls (e.g. function()) and assignments (e.g. a = “b”). This will get you most of the way. You are a developer, you know how to pick up the basics of a language real fast. Just get started and dive into the details later.
